## Configuration

`config/position_trading_config.py`

Key settings include:
- Entry timeframe: D1 (Daily)
- Background timeframe: W1 (Weekly)
- Confirmation timeframe: H4 (4-hour)
- Risk per trade: 1%
- Maximum portfolio heat: 6%
- Minimum confidence: 70%

## Usage

### Enabling Position Trading Mode

1. Set the entry timeframe in your configuration:
```python
TRADING_ENTRY_TIMEFRAME=D1
```

2. The system will automatically:
   - Switch to position trading mode
   - Use appropriate timeframes for analysis
   - Apply position trading constraints
   - Enable daily position monitoring

### Monitoring Positions

The Position Monitor provides several key functions:

```python
# Monitor all positions
position_health = await position_monitor.monitor_all_positions()

# Execute recommended adjustments
adjustments = await position_monitor.execute_position_adjustments(position_health)

# Generate daily review
review = await position_monitor.generate_daily_review()

# Check for time-based exits
exits_needed = await position_monitor.check_time_based_exits()
```

### Trading Constraints

When in position trading mode, the system enforces:
- Minimum time between trades (24/48 hours)
- Maximum concurrent positions (4)
- Session-based trading (avoiding low-liquidity hours)
- Higher confidence thresholds (70%+)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Noise**: Daily/weekly timeframes filter out intraday volatility
2. **Better Risk-Reward**: Wider stops allow for 3:1 to 5:1 R:R ratios
3. **Lower Frequency**: Fewer trades reduce costs and stress
4. **Professional Management**: Automated position monitoring and adjustments
5. **Risk Control**: Strict portfolio heat limits and correlation monitoring
