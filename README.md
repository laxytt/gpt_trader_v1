üöÄ How to Use the GPT Trading System

  Overview

  This is an automated trading system that combines GPT-4 AI analysis with machine learning to make trading decisions on MetaTrader 5. It
  monitors multiple currency pairs, analyzes market conditions, and executes trades automatically.

  Prerequisites

  1. MetaTrader 5 installed and logged into your broker account
  2. Python 3.8+ installed
  3. OpenAI API key with GPT-4 access
  4. Windows OS (required for MetaTrader 5 integration)

  Initial Setup

  1. Environment Configuration

  Create a .env file in the project root:
  # OpenAI Configuration
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

  # MetaTrader 5 Configuration
  MT5_FILES_DIR=C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Roaming/MetaQuotes/Terminal/YourBrokerID/MQL5/Files

  # Optional: Telegram Notifications
  TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-bot-token
  TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your-chat-id

  2. Install Dependencies

  # Create virtual environment
  python -m venv venv

  # Activate it (Windows)
  venv\Scripts\activate

  # Install packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  Running the System

  1. Live Trading Mode

  # Set Python path (PowerShell)
  $env:PYTHONPATH = "D:\gpt_trader_v1"

  # Run the main trading loop
  python trading_loop.py

  What happens:
  - System connects to MT5
  - Monitors configured symbols (EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc.)
  - Every hour on the hour:
    - Analyzes market conditions
    - Generates trading signals using GPT-4 + ML
    - Executes trades if opportunities found
    - Manages open positions

  2. Backtesting Mode

  # Run historical backtest
  python run_backtest.py

  What happens:
  - Tests strategy on historical data
  - Generates performance reports
  - Saves results to backtest_results/

  Key Features & How They Work

  1. Signal Generation Flow

  Market Data ‚Üí Technical Analysis ‚Üí ML Model (if available) ‚Üí GPT-4 Validation ‚Üí Trading Signal

  - ML-First: If ML model is deployed and confident (>70%), it makes the decision
  - GPT Validation: Low confidence ML signals are validated by GPT-4
  - Pure GPT: Falls back to GPT-only if no ML model available

  2. Risk Management

  The system enforces multiple risk controls:
  - Per-Trade Risk: Default 1.5% of account per trade
  - Portfolio Limits: Max 3 open trades, max 10% total exposure
  - Correlation Check: Prevents opening correlated positions
  - Drawdown Control: Reduces activity during drawdowns

  3. Trade Management

  Once a trade is open:
  - Continuous Monitoring: Checks positions every cycle
  - Dynamic Decisions: GPT analyzes whether to HOLD, MOVE_SL, or CLOSE_NOW
  - News Awareness: Closes trades before high-impact news events

  Configuration Options

  Trading Settings (config/settings.py)

  # Trading hours (UTC)
  start_hour = 7  # 7 AM UTC
  end_hour = 23   # 11 PM UTC

  # Risk settings
  risk_per_trade_percent = 1.5
  max_open_trades = 3

  # Symbols to trade
  symbols = ["EURUSD", "GBPUSD", "USDCAD"]  # Or use symbol groups

  Symbol Groups (config/symbols.py)

  - Conservative: Major pairs only (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY)
  - Moderate: Includes minor pairs
  - Aggressive: Adds commodities and indices

  Monitoring & Logs

  1. Console Output

  Shows real-time activity:
  2024-01-20 10:00:00 | Signal generated for EURUSD: BUY (Risk: A)
  2024-01-20 10:00:05 | Trade executed: TRADE_123456
  2024-01-20 11:00:00 | Managing trade TRADE_123456: MOVE_SL to breakeven

  2. Log Files

  Detailed logs saved to logs/trading_system.log

  3. Telegram Notifications (if configured)

  - Trade executions
  - System status updates
  - Error alerts

  Database & Memory

  The system maintains several databases:
  - trades.db: All trade history and performance
  - Memory System: Learns from past trades using FAISS vector search
  - Model Storage: Trained ML models in models/ directory

  Advanced Usage

  1. Deploy ML Models

  # After training a model via backtesting
  # Models meeting performance criteria are auto-deployed

  2. A/B Testing

  The system can run experiments comparing strategies:
  - GPT-only vs ML-driven
  - Different risk parameters
  - Various technical indicators

  3. Portfolio Analysis

  # Check portfolio risk status
  GET /api/portfolio/risk  # If API enabled

  Safety Features

  1. Circuit Breakers: Temporarily disable failing services
  2. Max Loss Limits: Stops trading after significant losses
  3. News Filtering: Avoids trading during major events
  4. Validation: Multiple checks before executing trades

  Typical Daily Operation

  1. Start System: Launch before market open
  2. Automatic Operation: System runs autonomously
  3. Monitor: Check logs/Telegram for activity
  4. End of Day: System continues running or can be stopped

  Troubleshooting

  MT5 Connection Issues:
  - Ensure MT5 is running and logged in
  - Check MT5_FILES_DIR path is correct
  - Verify algo trading is enabled in MT5

  No Trades Executing:
  - Check market hours settings
  - Verify symbols are available in MT5
  - Review risk settings (may be too restrictive)
  - Check logs for GPT API errors

  Performance Issues:
  - Reduce number of symbols
  - Increase analysis cycle time
  - Check API rate limits

  Best Practices

  1. Start Small: Test with minimal risk settings first
  2. Monitor Closely: Especially during first week
  3. Review Daily: Check trade logs and performance
  4. Update News Data: Keep economic calendar current
  5. Backtest Changes: Test any strategy modifications

  The system is designed to run continuously during market hours, making intelligent trading decisions while managing risk at both trade and
  portfolio levels.
