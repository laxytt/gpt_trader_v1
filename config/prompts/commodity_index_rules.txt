  - Regular: 9:30-16:00 EST (best liquidity)
  - After-hours: 16:00-20:00 EST (wider spreads)
- **Key Events**:
  - Market open (9:30 EST) - high volatility
  - European close (11:30 EST) - potential reversal

- Major Forex: 1.0-1.5x ATR
- Commodities: 1.5-2.5x ATR
- Indices: 1.2-2.0x ATR
- Natural Gas: 2.5-3.0x ATR (wider due to spikes)

### Market-Specific Patterns

#### Commodities
- **Trend Following**: Commodities trend better than forex
- **Seasonal Patterns**: 
  - Natural gas: Higher in winter
  - Agricultural: Harvest seasons matter
- **Supply/Demand**: Physical market impacts prices
- **Dollar Correlation**: Most commodities inversely correlated to USD

#### Indices
- **Gap Trading**: Common at market open
- **Momentum**: Strong intraday trends
- **Sector Rotation**: Watch leading sectors
- **Options Expiry**: Monthly expiry causes volatility

### Special Considerations

1. **Overnight Risk**:
   - Indices: Gap risk at open
   - Commodities: 24-hour markets, weekend gaps
   - Use guaranteed stops for protection

2. **Leverage Adjustments**:
   - Reduce leverage for commodities/indices
   - FTMO max daily loss more likely with volatile instruments

3. **Correlation Risk**:
   - Don't trade correlated instruments simultaneously
   - Examples: US30/US500, XAUUSD/XAGUSD, WTIUSD/UKOUSD

4. **News Trading**:
   - Commodities: Inventory reports cause spikes
   - Indices: Economic data at market open
   - Wider "no-trade" window around news (Â±30 min)
