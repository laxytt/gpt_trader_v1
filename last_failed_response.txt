{
  "signal": "WAIT",
  "reason": "Although M5 is above EMA50 and RSI is rising, the very last candle is a low volume doji with no clear follow-through, and ATR is low. H1 shows the up move but no volume spike or VSA confirmation like stopping volume, test, or two-bar reversal; therefore, VSA confirmation is lacking and context is not strong enough for entry."
