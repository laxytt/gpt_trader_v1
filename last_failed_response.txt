  "risk_class": "B",
  "reason": "No valid H1 momentum breakout or impulse candle at session latest close: price is above EMAs and prior uptrend confirmed on H4 (trend up), but H1 RSI is falling (65.6 from 72), no new 10-bar high, last bar's body is not >1.2×ATR, and volume is not elevated. No clear VSA bullish sequence—latest volume is average, recent spread narrowing suggests possible absorption or pause, not a confirmed No Supply test. Wait for fresh momentum breakout with volume and VSA confirmation."
}
```
**Rationale breakdown:**
- **Momentum:** No new 10-bar high or impulse. Last H1 candle's close (3309.81) is below prior highs; body size not >1.2×ATR. While price is above both EMAs, RSI is dropping and not >70.
- **VSA:** No clear stopping volume, two-bar reversal, or classic VSA BUY pattern. Volume is not significantly above median.
- **H4 Trend:** Strong uptrend background, so only considering BUY signals.
- **Entry Risk/Filters:** ATR and volume short-term adequate, but signal not present; no imminent macro news risk.
- **Action:** WAIT for a new qualified breakout or a clean VSA confirmation. No forced entry.
- **Risk class:** B (trend clear but entry not present, avoid forcing trades in strong directional move without clear secondary trigger confirmation).
