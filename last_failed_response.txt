  "reason": "Momentum breakout on H1: new 10-bar high close at 24113.8 with ATR and volume elevated, closing near highs. Both EMA50 and EMA200 are below price on H1 and H4, with RSI14 > 60 on both. H4 trend is strongly up, supported by a large impulsive H1 candle (entry bar) with high volume. VSA: No selling pressure seen after impulsive rally; previous candles show increasing volume on bullish closes and no immediate upthrusts or supply absorption. No high-impact news in next 2 minutes. Conditions support further trend continuation."
